# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
- This file gives Codex (and other agents) project-specific instructions.
- Keep it short and update it when workflows change.

## Project overview
- Static site repo with HTML/CSS/JS plus Python utilities.
- Key files: index.html, styles.css, script.js

## Common tasks
- Edit UI: update `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
- Blog content lives under `blogs/`.

## Run / Build
- No build step required for static edits.
- If using Python helpers, use `python main.py` (adjust as needed).

## Testing
- No automated tests defined.
- Manually open `index.html` in a browser to verify layout and interactions.

## Style
- Prefer small, focused changes.
- Keep CSS and JS readable and commented only when needed.

## Deployment
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` if publishing is required.

## Notes
- Update this file when new tooling or workflows are added.
